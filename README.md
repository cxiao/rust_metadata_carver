Find metadata in Rust binaries

![A screenshot of the Tags interface in Binary Ninja, showing a large number of tags labelled with the source file path, source file line, and source file column of panic location metadata embedded inside a Rust binary. For example, one tag has the label "library\std\src\sys\windows\c.rs: line 1362, col 9". All tags are using the ðŸ˜± emoji as an icon.](images/panic-path-tags-screenshot-border.png)
